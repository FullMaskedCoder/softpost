<h1>1 - SETS</h1>
<h3>A set is a well-defined collection of objects.

    A set which does not contain any element is called empty set.
    A set which consists of a definite number of elements is called finite set, otherwise, the set is called infinite set.
    Two sets A and B are said to be equal if they have exactly the same elements.
    A set A is said to be subset of a set B, if every element of A is also an element of B. Intervals are subsets of R.
    The union of two sets A and B is the set of all those elements which are either in A or in B.
    The intersection of two sets A and B is the set of all elements which are common. The difference of two sets A and B in this order is the set of elements which belong to A but not to B.
    The complement of a subset A of universal set U is the set of all elements of U which are not the elements of A.

For any two sets A and B,
(A∪B)′=A′∩B′and(A∩B)′=A′∪B′
(A∪B)′=A′∩B′and(A∩B)′=A′∪B′</h3>
<h1>2 - RELATIONS AND FUNCTIONS</h1>

    <h3>Ordered pair A pair of elements grouped together in a particular order.
    Cartesian product A × B of two sets A and B is given byA×B=(a,b):a∈A,b∈BA×B=(a,b):a∈A,b∈B
    In particular R×R=(x,y):x,y∈RR×R=(x,y):x,y∈R  and R×R×R=(x,y,z):x,y,z∈RR×R×R=(x,y,z):x,y,z∈R
    If (a, b) = (x, y), then a = x and b = y.
    If n(A) = p and n(B) = q, then n(A × B) = pq.
    A × φ = φ
    In general, A × B ≠ B × A.
    Relation A relation R from a set A to a set B is a subset of the cartesian product A × B obtained by describing a relationship between the first element x and the second element y of the ordered pairs in A × B.
    The image of an element x under a relation R is given by y, where (x, y) ∈ R,
    The domain of R is the set of all first elements of the ordered pairs in a relation R.
    The range of the relation R is the set of all second elements of the ordered pairs in a relation R.
    Function A function f from a set A to a set B is a specific type of relation for which every element x of set A has one and only one image y in set B. We write f: A→B, where f(x) = y.
    A is the domain and B is the codomain of f.
    The range of the function is the set of images.
    A real function has the set of real numbers or one of its subsets both as its domain and as its range.
    Algebra of functions For functions f : X → R and g : X → R, we have
    (f + g) (x) = f (x) + g(x), x ∈ X
    (f – g) (x) = f (x) – g(x), x ∈ X
    (f.g) (x) = f (x) .g (x), x ∈ X
    (kf) (x) = k ( f (x) ), x ∈ X, where k is a real number.</h3>

<h1>5 - LINEAR INEQUALITIES</h1>

    <h3>Two real numbers or two algebraic expressions related by the symbols <,>,≤or≥<,>,≤or≥ form an inequality.
    Equal numbers may be added to (or subtracted from ) both sides of an inequality.
    Both sides of an inequality can be multiplied (or divided ) by the same positive number. But when both sides are multiplied (or divided) by a negative number, then the inequality is reversed.
    The values of x, which make an inequality a true statement, are called solutions of the inequality.
    To represent x<a(or x>a)x<a(or x>a) on a number line, put a circle on the number a and dark line to the left (or right) of the number a.
    To represent x ≤ a (or x ≥ a) on a number line, put a dark circle on the number a and dark the line to the left (or right) of the number x.</h3>

<h1>8 - SEQUENCES AND SERIES</h1>
<h3>By a sequence, we mean an arrangement of number in definite order according to some rule. Also, we define a sequence as a function whose domain is the set of natural numbers or some subsets of the type  1,2,3,....k1,2,3,....k . A sequence containing a finite number of terms is called a finite sequence. A sequence is called infinite if it is not a finite sequence. Let a1, a2, a3, ... be the sequence, then the sum expressed as a1 + a2 + a3 + ... is called series. A series is called finite series if it has got finite number of terms. A sequence is said to be a geometric progression or G.P., if the ratio of any term to its preceding term is same throughout. This constant factor is called the common ratio. Usually, we denote the first term of a G.P. by a and its common ratio by r. The general or the nthnth term of GP is given by
an=arn−1

<h1>11 - INTRODUCTION TO THREE DIMENSIONAL GEOMETRY</h1>
<h3>In three dimensions, the coordinate axes of a rectangular Cartesian coordinate system are three mutually perpendicular lines. The axes are called the x, y and z-axes. ®The three planes determined by the pair of axes are the coordinate planes, called XY, YZ and ZX-planes. ®The three coordinate planes divide the space into eight parts known as octants. ®The coordinates of a point P in three dimensional geometry is always written in the form of triplet like (x, y, z). Here x, y and z are the distances from the YZ, ZX and XY-planes.

    Any point on x-axis is of the form (x, 0, 0)
    Any point on y-axis is of the form (0, y, 0)
    Any point on z-axis is of the form (0, 0, z)

Distance between two points P(x1, y1, z1) and Q (x2, y2, z2) is given by
(x2−x1)2+(y2−y1)2+(z2−z1)2
(x2​−x1​)2+(y2​−y1​)2+(z2​−z1​)2</h3>

<h1>12 - LIMITS AND DERIVATIVES</h1>
<h3>Limits and derivatives fall under calculus. So let us try to understand calculus first. The expected value of the function as dictated by the points to the left of a point defines the left hand limit of the function at that point. Similarly the right hand limit. Limit of a function at a point is the common value of the left and right hand limits, if they coincide. For a function f and a real number a, lim⁡x→af(x)x→alim​f(x)  and f(a)f(a) may not be same (In fact, one may be defined and not the other one). For functions f and g the following holds:
lim⁡x→a[f(x)±g(x)]=lim⁡x→af(x)±lim⁡x→ag(x)
x→alim​[f(x)±g(x)]=x→alim​f(x)±x→alim​g(x)
lim⁡x→a[f(x)⋅g(x)]=lim⁡x→af(x)⋅lim⁡x→ag(x)
x→alim​[f(x)⋅g(x)]=x→alim​f(x)⋅x→alim​g(x)
lim⁡x→a[f(x)g(x)]=lim⁡x→af(x)lim⁡x→ag(x)
x→alim​[g(x)f(x)​]=x→alim​g(x)x→alim​f(x)​
Following are some of the standard limits
lim⁡x→a[xn−anx−a]=nan−1
x→alim​[x−axn−an​]=nan−1
lim⁡x→0[sin(x)x]=1
x→0lim​[xsin(x)​]=1
lim⁡x→0[1−cos(x)x]=0
x→0lim​[x1−cos(x)​]=0
The derivative of a function f at a is defined by
f′(a)=lim⁡h→0[f(a+h)−f(a)h]
f′(a)=h→0lim​[hf(a+h)−f(a)​]
Derivative of a function f at any point x is defined by
f′(x)=df(x)dx=lim⁡h→0[f(x+h)−f(x)h]
f′(x)=dxdf(x)​=h→0lim​[hf(x+h)−f(x)​]
For functions u and v the following holds
(u±v)′=u′±v′
(u±v)′=u′±v′
(uv)′=u′v+uv′
(uv)′=u′v+uv′
(uv)′=u′v−uv′v2
(vu​)′=v2u′v−uv′​
provided all are provided

Some standard derivatives -
ddx(xn)=nxn−1
dxd​(xn)=nxn−1
ddx(sin(x))=cos(x)
dxd​(sin(x))=cos(x)
ddx(cos(x))=−sin(x)
dxd​(cos(x))=−sin(x)</h3>
